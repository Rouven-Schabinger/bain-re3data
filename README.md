# Examples for using the re3data API

[re3data](https://www.re3data.org/) is a global registry providing detailed descriptions of more than 2600 research data repositories. These descriptions are based on the [re3data Metadata Schema](https://www.re3data.org/schema/2-2) and can be accessed via the [re3data API](https://www.re3data.org/api/doc).

There are many conceivable use cases for re3data metadata. In this GitHub repository, we provide some examples for using the re3data API.
The examples are implemented in R using Jupyter Notebooks, which can be run in binder here (it may take a while to build):

Currently, we provide notebooks for three use cases:
* **re3data_API_medical_research_community.ipynb** - identify and collect information about repositories catering to the medical research community
* **re3data_API_certification_by_type.ipynb** - distribution of certificates across repository types
* **re3data_API_repository_APIs.ipynb** - collect information on repository APIs

The notebooks can be adapted to fit other use cases. If your specific use case is not covered here, feel free to [contact us](mailto:info@re3data.org).
